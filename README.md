# Gun Detection System using YOLOv5  

## Overview  
This project implements a **real-time firearm detection system** using **YOLOv5**, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection. The system is designed to enhance public safety by identifying weapons in live video feeds and triggering alerts for immediate response.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Detection**: Uses YOLOv5 for fast and accurate firearm detection.  
- **Live Surveillance Integration**: Processes video frames from connected cameras.  
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends email and SMS notifications upon weapon detection.  
- **Web Interface**: Displays detection results with bounding boxes for better visualization.  
- **Optimized Model**: Fine-tuned for improved precision and recall.  

## Dataset  
The model is trained on the **WeaponData** dataset from Roboflow:  
ðŸ”— [WeaponData Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/object-detection/weapondata)  

## Technologies Used  
- **Deep Learning**: YOLOv5, PyTorch  
- **Web Framework**: Flask  
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV  
- **Backend Services**: SMTP for email alerts  

## Future Enhancements  
- **Expand detection to a wider range of weapons**  
- **Improve detection accuracy with larger datasets**  
- **Integrate with advanced surveillance systems**  
- **Optimize model performance for real-time applications**  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Run the detection model  
4. Access results via the web interface  

ðŸš€ **Enhancing security with AI-powered firearm detection!**
